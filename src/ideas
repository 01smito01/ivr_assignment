Vision:
Camera 1 can be used to get the y & z coords of a blob.
Camera 2 can be used to get the x & z coords of a blob.

Together these can be used to generate 3D coordinates of each blob.
Using vector maths we can calculate angles.

If only I could get the callbacks working.


FK:
Get joint angles from part 2
Get link lengths from pdf.
